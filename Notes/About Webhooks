Webhooks are more of a style than a spec (think REST vs SOAP). essentially webhooks are HTTP callbacks,
They're usually triggered by events of some sort. They can be used anywhere from continuous integration, to notications for web apps.

Fufillment - typically used to describe the end point of the webhook flow, might be more common when when you have two-way integration. Might be specific to Google DialogueFlow

Payload - the content delivered by the webhook that can be processed by the recipient

Webhook secret - key used to verify that incoming webhook requests


Github and Travis CI.

Travis CI uses github webhook events to trigger builds. Github previously did this via a service (todo: figure out difference between the newer webhooks and the older service).


-Webhook events can be forwarded
	-example. Git can push a commit even to then be built by travis.
	-once travis passes the build it can pass an event to somewhere else to
	 trigger a deployment

-Event server vs. Listening server

-Discord Returns a 204 success code to github upon send (204 = No content)
- alternatively might be 202 (accepted)


Github secret, use:

ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'
